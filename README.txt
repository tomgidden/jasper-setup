jasper-setup
============

This repo is just to make available code zips that have gone AWOL thanks
to Google Code's deprecation.  The full licenses of these excellent
open-source software products should be respected, and I apologise
if _caching_ these distfiles on GitHub violates such licenses, and will
happily take down these files if requested to do so by the project authors.

I have no particular expertise in configuring any of these projects, incl.
the `jasper-setup.sh` script.  Any questions should be directed to the
projects themselves.
